                My name is Alex Rivera but alot of my closest friends call me "Tach" <em>(childhood nickname that I don't quite remember how I got)</em>. I am originally from Connecticut but probably have lived even longer in Orlando, FL now. I am an aspiring programmer, a gamer, a gearhead, a tech enthusiast, and a hobbyist artist although I've been slacking in the art department lately. Though I don't have any kids of my own I am big on family and spend as much time as possible with my nieces and nephew.

                I've been working hard since I was 14 <em>(I mean 15 ehem legally)</em> working with my dad, pressure washing hotels at disney resorts on weekends. I then went on to work every holiday, spring, and summer break at a warehouse making insulation for commercial steel buildings until 2008. Now I work in supply chain management at a local hospital in the Procurement/Purchasing department as a Purchasing asst./courier.
